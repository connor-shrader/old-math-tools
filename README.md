## About this Project

This project will feature a collection of online calculators related to math.
My primary goal with this project is to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I am currently learning.
My secondary goal is to create simple yet useful tools for various mathematical problems.

This project only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I want to focus on learning front-end development.

The webpage can be accessed at [https://connor-shrader.github.io/Math-Tools/](https://connor-shrader.github.io/Math-Tools/).
Keep in mind that this project is brand new, and that this is my first extensive project using front-end languages.

## Planned Tools

Some tools that I am thinking of making include:

* Linear Regression (which I can extend to include quadratic regression, and even polynomial interpolation)
* Modular Exponentiation
* System of Linear Equations
