# old-math-tools

A simple website with calculators for linear regression and modular exponentiation.

## About this Project

This project is a basic website with two math-related calculators.
My primary goal with this project was to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A second goal was to create some simple yet useful mathematical tools.

This project only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I wanted to focus on learning front-end development.

## New math-tools

I am no longer working on this project. Any future tools that I make will be in my newer [math-tools](https://connor-shrader.github.io/math-tools/) repository. This newer repository uses Python and Flask, which will allow me to make better programs.
